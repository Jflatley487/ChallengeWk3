# ChallengeWk3

In this challenge, we were told to create a landing page for a portfolio to display our work. Making use of HTML and CSS tools, I made a hypothetical landing page, complete with some work I would like to do in the future. During this challenge, I gained a greater understanding of CSS and tools such as psuedo-code and flex box properties.
